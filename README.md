# odin-recipes
First project with Html in TOP ( The Odin Project )

A project which has a menu of food recipes in the homepage. Each line of the list is a link that goes to another html file which explains the recipe of that food completely.

It was a great experience. I learned new things like how to make multiple html files in a directory that connect with eachother!
