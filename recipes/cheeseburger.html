A dollop of creamy mayonnaise and a squirt of ketchup add a delightful touch of indulgence. Each bite delivers a symphony of flavors and textures that will transport you to burger heaven.

    <br>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><b>Prepare the Ingredients:</b> <br> Gather ground beef, burger buns, cheese slices, lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, onions, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, and any additional toppings you desire. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Shape the Patties:</b> <br> Divide the ground beef into equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Season each patty with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Preheat the Grill or Pan:</b> <br> Preheat your grill or a pan over medium-high heat. Grease the grill grates or pan with a bit of cooking oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cook the Patties:</b> <br> Place the patties on the hot grill or pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your preferred doneness.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Melt the Cheese:</b> <br> About a minute before the patties are done, place a cheese slice on each patty to allow it to melt.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Toast the Buns:</b> <br> While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until they're golden brown.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Assemble the Burgers:</b> <br> Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard on the bottom bun. Place the cooked patty with melted cheese on top. Add lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and onions, followed by the top bun.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> <br> Carefully slide the pizza (on parchment paper if using a baking sheet) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Serve and Enjoy:</b> <br> Serve your classic cheeseburger hot with your favorite side dishes, like french fries or coleslaw.</li>
