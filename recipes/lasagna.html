    <br>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><b>Prepare the Ingredients:</b> <br> Gather lasagna noodles, ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination), ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, onions, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cook the Noodles:</b> <br> Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Brown the Meat:</b> <br> In a large skillet, cook the ground meat over medium-high heat until it's browned and crumbled. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Sauté Onions and Garlic:</b> <br> In the same skillet, sauté chopped onions and minced garlic until they are soft and fragrant.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Season the Sauce:</b> <br> Add tomato sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet with the meat, onions, and garlic. Simmer for 10-15 minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> <br> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Layer the Lasagna:</b> <br> In a baking dish, start with a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of cooked noodles, a layer of ricotta cheese, and a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process until you've used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> <br> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the top is bubbly and golden</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Let it Rest:</b> <br> Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Serve and Enjoy:</b> <br> Cut into portions, serve your homemade lasagna hot, and savor the layers of deliciousness!</li>
