    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough</li>
            <li>Tomato pizza sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
            <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>Olive oil (for brushing the crust, optional)</li>
            <li>Dried oregano (optional, for seasoning)</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for added heat)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> <br> Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside while preheating. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> <br> Roll out your pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. You can make it round or rectangular, depending on your preference.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Assemble the Pizza:</b> <br> Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If using a pizza stone, sprinkle cornmeal or flour on the pizza peel to prevent sticking.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Add Sauce:</b> <br> Spread a generous amount of tomato pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Layer Cheese:</b> <br> Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Add Pepperoni:</b> <br> Place pepperoni slices evenly over the cheese. You can use as much or as little as you like, depending on your preference.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Season:</b> <br> Optionally, sprinkle some dried oregano and red pepper flakes over the top for extra flavor.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> <br> Carefully slide the pizza (on parchment paper if using a baking sheet) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cool and Slice:</b> <br> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, slice it into wedges or squares, and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!</p>
